## Overview

This is a calculator application for the Black Ops 6 Terminus Zombies Map code. The repository appears to be in its initial setup phase with only a basic README file present. This is a gaming utility tool designed to help players with code calculations specific to the Terminus map in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies mode.

## System Architecture

The system architecture is not yet defined as the project is in its initial setup phase. Based on the project description, this will likely be a simple calculator application that could be implemented as:

- A web-based calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A standalone desktop application
- A mobile-friendly web app

The architecture will be determined based on the specific requirements for the Terminus map code calculations.

## Key Components

Currently, no key components are implemented. The following components are anticipated based on the project purpose:

1. **Calculator Interface** - User interface for inputting values and displaying results
2. **Calculation Logic** - Core algorithms for processing Terminus map codes
3. **Input Validation** - Ensuring user inputs are valid for the calculations
4. **Results Display** - Formatted output of calculated codes or solutions

## Data Flow

Data flow is not yet established. The expected flow would be:

1. User inputs initial values or parameters
2. Application processes inputs through calculation algorithms
3. Results are computed and validated
4. Final codes/solutions are displayed to the user

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies are currently defined. Potential dependencies may include:

- Web framework (if web-based)
- UI libraries for enhanced user experience
- Math libraries for complex calculations (if needed)

## Deployment Strategy

Deployment strategy is not yet defined. Options may include:

- Static web hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- Replit hosting for easy access and sharing
- Desktop application distribution
- Mobile app stores (if mobile version is developed)
